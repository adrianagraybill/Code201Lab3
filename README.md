# Code201Lab3

This lab is building on lab 2, I will be adding a numbered list, a couple more questions, and a tally total for the user to see results.

Ryan Webking was the driver, we made a lot of changes by adding 6 and 7. We used arrays and a for loop. After working as a team of 3 we learned the power of arrays and functions. We also used 

Ryan drove for me(Adriana)
Adriana drove for Jonny
Jonny drove for Ryan

Adriana navigated Ryan
Ryan navigated Jonny
Jonny navigated Adriana

Once Ryan and I finished our end I worked with Jon and made more strucutred complicated arrays/loops, and functions. 

Now that everything has been brought back to me, I have updated my code to match the code I wrote when Jon and I were a team.
