      <p> Here's a little bio. I came to the US when I was only 3 years 
        old. I have lived in Seattle since then. This city has given me so much 
        and I love it here. Yes, the weather can put me down at times, but I am 
        always grateful to be here.
      <br>
      <br>
        My teen years I went to Aviation High School, swam for a year round club team, and 
        worked as a lifeguard. 
      <br>
      <br>
        When I graduated I wasn't quite ready for college, I thought I wanted to be a 
        philosophy major but dropped out  because I didn't know what I 
        wanted to do, so I just joined the work force. I worked for Alaska a few years, 
        but I always regretted not pushing myself academically.
      <br>
      <br>
        I have been wasting years of my life trying to figure stuff out, I decided 
        to give school another shot. I went to Highline College and signed up for 
        CS 101, I liked the content but hated the learning style. I already knew 
        so much and felt like I was wasting time. That's when I decided to try Code 
        Fellows.
      <br>
      <br>
        Now I am 23 years old, one week in, and I already have a great feeling about 
        this! I am so excited!
      <br>
      <br>
        If you managed to get through that, the rest should be pretty easy :)

      <section><b><u>Some of my favorite things in life:</u></b>
      <dl>
        <dt><b>People</b></dt>
          <dd>Yes, a millenial that loves people, crazy right? I 
          think humans are facinating and being around others 
          makes me very happy.</dd>
      <br>
        <dt><b>Movies/TV</b></dt>
          <dd>Since you answered all those questions, you already have 
            some sort of idea regarding this. I love being able to escape
             my own reality and really think through different perspectives. 
             Also cinematography is amazing! I am a very visual person and 
             get so lost in the moment.
          </dd>
      <br>
        <dt><b>Animals</b></dt>
          <dd>I currently own 2 dogs, my first one is named Friday after Tony 
            Stark's AI (the one that took over after Jarvis) and because it's 
            a great name. My second dog is Blaze, she is an extremely sweet 
            poofball of a dog. She is so affectionate and adores attention.
          </dd>
      <br>
        <dt><b>Food</b></dt>
          <dd>I absolutely love eating! Aside from keeping me alive, food 
            makes me so happy (good food that is). Coming from an extremely 
            traditionally Mexican family, our culture revolves around it. 
            I truly feel food and company is some of the best therapy out there.
